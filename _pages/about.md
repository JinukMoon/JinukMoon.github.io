<p>I am a passionate researcher dedicated to advancing the field of computational catalysis through innovative machine learning approaches. At the Computational Catalysis and Emerging Materials Laboratory (CCEL) under the guidance of Professor Jeong Woo Han at Seoul National University, I focus on developing novel catalysts and methodologies that bridge the gap between traditional computational methods and modern machine learning techniques.</p>

<p>My research specifically targets the enhancement of density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using machine learning algorithms, aiming to overcome the computational limitations of conventional methods and enable more efficient catalyst design and optimization.</p>

<p>I completed my undergraduate studies at POSTECH in 2023, where I developed a strong foundation in materials science and computational methods. Currently, I am pursuing my PhD at Seoul National University, where I continue to expand my expertise in machine learning applications for catalysis research.</p>

<p>Beyond my academic pursuits, I maintain a balanced lifestyle through various interests. I am an avid sports enthusiast, both as a spectator and participant, and find relaxation in music and cinema. These activities not only provide a creative outlet but also help me maintain a fresh perspective in my research work.</p>

<p>I am always excited to connect with fellow researchers and discuss potential collaborations. Whether you're interested in computational catalysis, machine learning applications, or simply want to exchange ideas, feel free to reach out through LinkedIn or email. I look forward to engaging in meaningful scientific discussions and potential collaborations!</p>
